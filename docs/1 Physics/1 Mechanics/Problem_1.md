# Problem 1

Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### Governing Equations of Motion
Projectile motion can be analyzed using Newton's laws of motion. Assuming no air resistance, the motion can be decomposed into horizontal and vertical components:

#### Equations of Motion:
- Horizontal motion:
  $$ x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) t $$
- Vertical motion:
  $$ y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$

where:

- $v_0$ is the initial velocity,
- $\theta$ is the launch angle,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
- $t$ is the time.

### Time of Flight:
Setting \( y(t) = 0 \) to find the total flight time:
$$ t_f = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} $$

### Range Formula:

The horizontal range \( R \) is given by:

$$ R = v_0 \cos(\theta) t_f = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} $$

This equation shows that the range is maximized at \( \theta = 45^\circ \), assuming other parameters remain constant.

## 2. Analysis of the Range

### Influence of Initial Conditions

- **Initial velocity (\( v_0 \))**: Increasing \( v_0 \) increases the range quadratically.
- **Gravitational acceleration (\( g \))**: Higher \( g \) reduces the range, as the projectile falls more quickly.
- **Launch angle (\( \theta \))**: The range follows a symmetric pattern, peaking at \( 45^\circ \).

### Graphical Representation

Below is a Python script to visualize how the range changes with \( \theta \):

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def range_function(theta, v0, g=9.81):
    return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * np.radians(theta))) / g

# Parameters
v0 = 20  # initial velocity in m/s
theta = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)  # range of angles
g = 9.81  # gravity

# Compute ranges
ranges = range_function(theta, v0, g)

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
plt.plot(theta, ranges, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s')
plt.xlabel('Launch Angle (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (m)')
plt.title('Projectile Range vs. Launch Angle')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

## 3. Practical Applications

- **Sports**: Understanding projectile motion helps in optimizing the throwing angles in sports like basketball, soccer, and javelin.
- **Engineering**: Used in ballistics, military applications, and designing trajectories for rockets and missiles.
- **Astrophysics**: Used to model celestial body trajectories and space exploration missions.

## 4. Implementation

A numerical simulation can further analyze cases involving air resistance. Incorporating drag force leads to differential equations that require numerical methods (e.g., Runge-Kutta) to solve.

### Example: Adding Air Resistance

The equations with drag $F_d = -k v^2$ lead to:

$$m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -k v_x^2$$
$$m \frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -mg - k v_y^2$$

A numerical solver like Python's SciPy can be used to compute solutions.

## 5. Limitations and Further Considerations

- **Air resistance**: Causes asymmetry and reduces range.
- **Uneven terrain**: Requires solving for complex boundary conditions.
- **Wind effects**: Affects trajectory unpredictably.

Future work could involve incorporating machine learning techniques to predict projectile trajectories in complex environments.

## Conclusion

Projectile motion demonstrates rich mathematical and physical insights. While the idealized model provides a good approximation, real-world adaptations require numerical solutions to account for non-ideal conditions.
